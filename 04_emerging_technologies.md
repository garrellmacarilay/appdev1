# Blockchain

## Purpose
The main purpose of Blockchain is to provide a secure, decentralized, and tamper-resistant digital ledger that enables multiple parties to share and verify data without the need for a central authority. Blockchain enhances trust, transparency, and security while also enabling automation through smart contracts.

## Usage
- **In Education**:  
  Blockchain is used in education for issuing and verifying academic credentials, diplomas, and certificates in a secure and verifiable way. For example, the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)** uses the **Blockcerts** platform to issue digital diplomas that graduates can store in a mobile wallet and share instantly with employers.

- **In IT**:  
  Blockchain is used in the IT industry for supply chain tracking, data sharing, and process automation. **Walmart**, for example, uses IBM’s **Food Trust** blockchain network to trace the origin of food products, reducing the trace time for some items from days to just a few seconds.

## Examples

- **In Education**:  
  **European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI)**, backed by the European Union, uses blockchain to support the issuance and verification of diplomas and micro-credentials across member states, making them portable and instantly verifiable.

- **In IT**:  
  **TradeLens**, a blockchain platform developed by Maersk and IBM, was designed to digitize global shipping documentation and improve supply chain transparency. Although discontinued in 2023 due to limited adoption, it demonstrated the potential and challenges of large-scale blockchain systems.
