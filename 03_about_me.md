## Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub

I want to learn Git & Github because it help me to understand the backend workflow or process of it. It help me to collaborate with my friends and classmates working on the same project at the same time with different locations efficiently. Understanding this can avoid merge conflicts in the future, although it is inevitable, but atleast minimize them. And Understanding the basic can help you to make a creative decision in debbuging problems.
